# WiPi-Wizard

WiPi-Wizard is a Raspberry Pi project that allows you to set up a Wi-Fi hotspot when no known Wi-Fi networks are available. The hotspot allows you to choose new Wi-Fi network and provide the passphrase for connection.

## Features

- Provides a web page for users to select and connect to a new Wi-Fi network.
- Easy installation and setup with an installation script.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi support (Make sure your Wi-Fi adapter supports Access Point mode).
